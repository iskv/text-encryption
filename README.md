# Text encryption
**Encryption-The Caesar Cipher.**
Offset of the alphabet character by k elements. Formula: c_new = (c_old + k) % n (n is the power of the alphabet).\n
**Decoding is a method of frequency analysis.**
Idea: analysis of the frequency of occurrence of characters in the language as such (in books, etc.) (frequency â€“ number of meetings / number of characters in the text). The comparison of the reference frequency symbols frequency symbols of the ciphertext.
